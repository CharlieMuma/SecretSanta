# SecretSanta
Python script that asks everyone for thier name an email. It then emails everyone who they have for secret santa.

You must change the 'username' to whatever your email address is and 'password' to the password.
You have to go into your google settings of the account and set it up so you can use an application password.

This was created for my Laurel Ridge CSC 221 Final. It was written in python.
